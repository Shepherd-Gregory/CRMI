# CRMI
Example for confidence-rich mutual information (CRMI)

## Readme
The previous MATLAB codes for confidence-rich mapping (CRM) scheme is here [[Link](https://github.com/Shepherd-Gregory/confidence_rich_mapping)].

This MATLAB codes is for CRMI based on the CRM. For more details, please see the following papers.
